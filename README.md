Playground for Spring Cloud Task 


From https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/docs/current/reference/html/#getting-started:

"Spring Cloud Task offers the ability to execute short-lived processes in an environment and record the results. Doing so allows for a microservices architecture around short-lived processes as well as longer running services through the integration of tasks by messages."
